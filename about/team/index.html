          <p>
            Our diverse team is made up from 6 different high schools in the El
            Dorado Union High School District. Even though we often compete in
            other venues, we are committed to working together! Currently, we
            have team members from Union Mine, Oak Ridge, Ponderosa, El Dorado,
            Shenandoah, and Independence High Schools. We are building a bot,
            pumped up, and ready for the competition. Go Circuit Breakers!

          <p>
            In 2008, the FIRST FRC game was RACK AND ROLL. Torgeir Lindborg, our
            first Team Captain, went to see the competition at UC Davis,
            Sacramento with his parents when he was in 8th grade. They found out
            about the competition through an announcement in the newspaper.
          </p>
          <p>
            Torgeir was inspired and hooked! He sought permission to start an
            FRC team at his high school when he was a freshman and received it.
            He looked on the FIRST website to find a team that would mentor us.
            The Elk Grove Herdinators informed him that it was too late in the
            year to start his own team, but invited him to join their team for
            the year. The 2009 FRC competition was LUNACY. Torgeir participated
            in that competition as a Herdinator and enjoyed the FRC signature...
          </p>
          <p>
            As a sophomore at Union Mine High School, Torgeir was able, with the
            help of the school faculty and his family, to start a district wide
            FRC Team. Another student, Emma Holm, jumped on board during the
            summer before the school year to help with fundraising and public
            relations. Torgeir and Emma began recruiting and discovered another
            student, Luke Jarrett, who held the vision for a robotics team as
            well and had been looking for a way to create a team. Word spread
            and before we knew it our team, the Circuit Breakers, #3189, was 32
            students and 11 mentors strong.
